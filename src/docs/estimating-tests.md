# Estimating Tests Plan

- computeSealcoatMaterials: verify gallons, sand bags, water gallons at varying porosity and oil spot areas.
- computeCrackFill: boxes and propane tanks vs linear feet; price mapping.
- computePatching: sqft to price mapping.
- computeStriping: linear feet, extras (HC, arrows, crosswalks count), paint color delta.
- computeFuelAndEquipment: mpg degradation, active fuel, idle cost.
- computeTransportLoad: include water and sand weight.
