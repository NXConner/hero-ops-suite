  - CSV import mapping with preview/validation

- Maps and Telemetry
  - Real employee tracking storage/queries; shifts; geofence CRUD/events and notifications
  - AI: segmentation mask â†’ vector polygons; store outlines and attach to projects/jobs
  - Routing provider keys and regional bias; caching and offline fallbacks

- QA/CI and Observability
  - Unit tests for pricing/import/invoices/gps/route/geofence events
  - E2E for OverWatch tools and builder flows; CI with lint/typecheck/test/build
  - Sentry and performance budgets

- UX/Perf polish
  - Mobile-friendly controls, clustering/heatmaps, saved layer presets, accessibility

Provide required env keys at runtime/build and add wallpaper/video assets to `public/` as needed.
