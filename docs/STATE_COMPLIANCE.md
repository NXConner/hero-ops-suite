## State compliance guide: Virginia and North Carolina

This guide summarizes common licensing, permitting, safety, environmental, tax, and recordkeeping considerations for small asphalt/paving/sealcoat businesses operating in Virginia and North Carolina. It is not legal advice. Verify with the relevant agencies before acting.

### How this maps into the platform

- Operations Suite and Fleet Focus Manager: track compliance tasks, expirations (licenses, insurance, permits), and safety training.
- Asphalt Atlas Hub: surface state specs, best practices, and links to authoritative resources.
- Estimator/Jobs: attach permits/COIs, add environmental controls (BMPs) and traffic control plans to job packets.

## Virginia (VA) compliance checklist

- Licensing and business registration
  - Register entity: Virginia SCC (foreign registration if formed out-of-state).
  - DPOR contractor license: if required by project scope/value. Confirm classification (e.g., Highway Heavy) and monetary limits.
  - Local business license (BPOL) where applicable.

- Permits and work-in-right-of-way
  - VDOT permits/encroachment for state-maintained roads (traffic control, lane closures, detours).
  - Local permits for private lots or locality-maintained roads as required.

- Standards and specifications
  - VDOT Road and Bridge Specifications and Road Design Manual for paving materials, placement, density, weather limits, and QC/QA.
  - MUTCD/VDOT Work Area Protection Manual for traffic control devices and setups.

- Safety and labor
  - OSHA compliance (PPE, silica dust, hot-work/asphalt exposure, equipment safety, hazard communication).
  - VOSH (Virginia state plan) applies; ensure training and recordkeeping meet state requirements.
  - Workers’ compensation (Virginia Workers’ Compensation Commission) and unemployment insurance (VEC).

- Environmental (DEQ)
  - Stormwater/NPDES: coverage where land disturbance or washout may introduce pollutants; BMPs for sealcoat/asphalt operations.
  - Waste handling: tack/sealcoat/solvents; proper storage, SDS, and disposal. Prevent runoff to storm drains.

- Vehicles and transport
  - DMV/VDOT weight/size limits; oversize/overweight permits if applicable. Hazmat rules for certain materials/quantities.
  - DOT numbers/CDL requirements where triggered by vehicle type/weight.

- Taxes and reporting
  - Virginia Department of Taxation: sales/use tax (materials) and employer withholding.
  - Federal: EIN, employment taxes, 1099s as applicable.

- Insurance and documentation
  - General liability, auto, equipment, and workers’ comp; maintain COIs per contract.
  - Job packets: site-specific traffic control, BMP plan, safety tailgate sheets, MSDS/SDS.

## North Carolina (NC) compliance checklist

- Licensing and business registration
  - Register entity: NC Secretary of State (foreign registration if formed out-of-state).
  - NC Licensing Board for General Contractors: license required when project value meets the statutory threshold (e.g., ≥ $40,000; verify current threshold and applicable classifications such as Highway).
  - Local privilege/business licenses where applicable.

- Permits and work-in-right-of-way
  - NCDOT encroachment/driveway permits for work impacting state-maintained roads or rights-of-way.
  - Local permits for private lots or municipal roads as required.

- Standards and specifications
  - NCDOT Standard Specifications and Roadway Standard Drawings for materials, mixtures, placement, density/QC, and weather constraints.
  - MUTCD/NCDOT for temporary traffic control.

- Safety and labor
  - NC DOL OSH (state OSHA plan) compliance: training, programs, recordkeeping (injury/illness logs).
  - Workers’ compensation (NC Industrial Commission) and unemployment insurance (NC DES).

- Environmental (NCDEQ)
  - NCG01 Construction Stormwater (as applicable), spill prevention, washout containment, and BMPs for sealcoat/asphalt.
  - Waste storage/transport/disposal in line with NCDEQ guidance; protect storm drains and waters.

- Vehicles and transport
  - NCDOT/DMV weight/size rules; oversize/overweight permits as needed.
  - DOT numbers/CDL where thresholds are met.

- Taxes and reporting
  - NC Department of Revenue: sales/use tax (materials), employer withholding.
  - Federal: EIN, employment taxes, 1099s as applicable.

  - Job packets: traffic control plan, BMP plan, safety briefing, MSDS/SDS.

## Operating in both VA and NC (cross-state considerations)

- Entity and licensing
  - Maintain registration in home state and foreign registration in the other.
  - Hold required contractor licenses in each state; reciprocity may allow exam waivers but does not eliminate license requirements.
  - Track monetary limits/classifications separately per state.

- Employment and insurance
  - Workers’ comp policies must cover employees in both states; verify state endorsements.
  - Unemployment insurance accounts in each state where payroll is reported.

- Taxes and nexus
  - Sales/use tax registration per state as required; determine taxability of services/materials per job.
  - Income/franchise tax filings per state where nexus exists.

- Safety and environmental programs
  - Adopt the stricter rule where VA vs. NC standards diverge (VOSH vs. NC OSH; DEQ vs. NCDEQ).
  - Company-wide BMPs for stormwater, material storage, and waste handling that satisfy both states.

- Transportation
  - Comply with each state’s DOT permitting for oversize/overweight; route planning across borders.

- Recordkeeping and audits
  - Centralize licenses, permits, training, inspections, and COIs; maintain job-specific packets for at least the statutory retention period.

## Platform implementation suggestions

- Checklists and alerts
  - Add per-state compliance checklists and expirations in Fleet Focus Manager (e.g., license renewal, insurance, permits, training).
  - Trigger job-level prompts for traffic control plans and BMPs when a job is tagged VA or NC.

- Document templates
  - Store traffic control plan templates, BMP checklists, and safety briefings; prefill with job details.

- Audit trail
  - Attach permits, COIs, SDS, and training certificates to jobs and employees; generate audit-ready reports.

- Future enhancements
  - State data packs in Asphalt Atlas Hub for VDOT/NCDOT specs and local permit contacts.
  - Automated reminders for license/permit expirations per state.

Note: Requirements change. Always verify current rules on official state sites (DPOR/VDOT/DEQ in VA; NCLBGC/NCDOT/NCDEQ in NC) and consult your legal/professional advisors.
